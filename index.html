  <body bgcolor="blue">
    <h1>Hello Frends!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my web page!  This is the <i><b>first</b></i> example from class.  I hope you like it.
    <p><a href="lists.htm">Here</a> Here is a page with some different lists.
    <p>Here's another paragraph.
    I typed this line without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right ntext to the previous
    sentence.  The web page <b>doesn't</b> preserve the same spacing.  It formats according to the tags it sees.
    So the line
    breaks
    are
    
    
    
    
    
    different
    from the 
    source 
    also.  <p><h2>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph.</h2>

      <img src= "IMG_20191114_131706.jpg"> width="50"> data-rotate="90">
    </a>
      


And a couple more blank lines afterward...
